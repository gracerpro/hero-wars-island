      "paragraph1": "Initially, there was a desire to make a functional where the available number of moves is entered and there is a button \"Find the best rewards\". When you click on the button, the path is calculated. A map is a set of nodes, similar to graphs. But when calculating, you need to take into account the human factor: it is more profitable for someone to take emeralds, and for someone to take stones of appearance. Therefore, I refused this functionality. Let the person build the path himself and receive the necessary rewards.",

      "reason1": "On the first map of the island, when a large number of moves were scored, it was difficult to calculate the moves and rewards. The best rewards are in the towers. The towers are located far from the center. Will there be enough moves before them?... It is difficult to calculate, very difficult. It is easier to mark the path as on a piece of paper.",
      "reason2": "With an open card available, it was also difficult to look for rewards. For example, emeralds are needed, there are hundreds of dots on the map with different pictures, among which it is not easy to see the right one. So you also need to remember... It's easier to filter the icons."
